 ZX80/ZX81 Cassette File Images

.81 and .80 Files
These are 1:1 copies of the content of real ZX81 and ZX80 cassette files.
ZX81 files are copies of the memory area 4009h up to E_LINE-1, the filename (which is usually part of ZX81 files) is not included in the file.
ZX80 files are copies of the memory area 4000h up to E_LINE-1, the filename is obviously not included as real ZX80 files do not have names.

.P and .O Files
Basically, these are identical as .81 (.P) and .80 (.O) files, except that an unpredictable amount of garbage is meant to be attached to each file.
Older versions of the Xtender emulator seem to have attached 1 byte of garbage. The current Xtender version apparently dropped this behaviour, and saves correct length. Files at ftp.nvg randomly contain between 28-38 bytes of garbage, probably caused by a cassette-to-disk transfer program. And some files appear to have went through a CP/M filesystem, which caused the length to be rounded up to multiples of 128 bytes.
Programs that deal with these files should determine the correct length (by examining the header/system area), and truncate the extra bytes.

.P Files with Filename
Some .P files contain the original "FILENAME.P" (in ZX81 charset) at 003Fh (within the PRBUFF area) (the purpose is probably to "preserve" long filenames in MSDOS) (the preceeding bytes at 003Ch are usually 00-1A-1C, or in FROGGER-HR: 00-1C-1C (unknown purpose)).
